# More catting practice 

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Il4-pIBmF3UKBgWvbMFy5Q7LrkX.QXwITO0wyM1gjNzEzW}`

the flag could be found in the absolute directory ` /usr/share/application-registry/flag`

```bash
Connected!
You cannot use the 'cd' command in this level, and must retrieve the flag by
absolute path. Plus, I hid the flag in a different directory! You can find it
in the file /usr/share/application-registry/flag. Go cat it out **without**
cding into that directory!
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /usr/share/application-registry/flag
pwn.college{Il4-pIBmF3UKBgWvbMFy5Q7LrkX.QXwITO0wyM1gjNzEzW}
```
