# Explicit relative paths, from /

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cUbh_RdkPxXHdFk5LBxjM2Dq0kg.QXwUTN0wyM1gjNzEzW}`

from the previous challenge I understood that I must use the specified format which was using `.` in this case

```bash
Connected!
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ ./challenge/run
Correct!!!
./challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{cUbh_RdkPxXHdFk5LBxjM2Dq0kg.QXwUTN0wyM1gjNzEzW}
```
