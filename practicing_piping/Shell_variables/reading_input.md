# Reading input

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YzmuCFkGOJc6aGIO-VmtBRCXefg.QX4cTN0wyM1gjNzEzW}`

```bash
Connected!
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read -p "INPUT: " PWN
INPUT: COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{YzmuCFkGOJc6aGIO-VmtBRCXefg.QX4cTN0wyM1gjNzEzW}
```
