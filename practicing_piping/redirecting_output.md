You have created the COLLEGE file, but you didn't write the correct value to
it. Make sure to write PWN to the COLLEGE file.
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your
flag:
pwn.college{ASok4FXWPsHv4rXB0At5RMyxFVy.QX0YTN0wyM1gjNzEzW}
```
