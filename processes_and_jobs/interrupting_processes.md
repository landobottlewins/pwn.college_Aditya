# interrupting processes

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sN2gQbQJSz7L8JewHtXYlTrI2WD.QXzQDO0wyM1gjNzEzW}`

```bash
Connected!                                                                        
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember, 
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
Good job! You have used Ctrl-C to interrupt this process! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{sN2gQbQJSz7L8JewHtXYlTrI2WD.QXzQDO0wyM1gjNzEzW}
